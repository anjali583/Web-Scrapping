**Web Scraping Using acko-drive**
Web scraping is a technique used to extract data from websites programmatically, facilitating automated data retrieval for various purposes such as research, analysis, or data aggregation. acko-drive is a Python package designed to simplify the process of web scraping by providing a user-friendly interface and tools for navigating and extracting data from web pages.

**Steps for web scrapping**
**1.Setup and Libraries:** 
- Install necessary libraries like requests for making HTTP requests and BeautifulSoup for parsing HTML.
- Ensure Python is installed on your system.

**2.Identify GitHub Repository URL:**
- Choose the GitHub repository you want to scrape. Example: https://github.com/username/repository.

**3.HTTP Request:**
- Use requests library to send a GET request to the repository URL.
- Handle response codes (200 for success) and potential errors.
  
**4.Parse HTML:**
- Utilize BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML content received from the GitHub page.
- Navigate through the HTML structure to find relevant data such as repository name, description, stars, forks, contributors, etc.

**5.Data Extraction:**
- Extract specific elements from the parsed HTML using CSS selectors or other methods provided by BeautifulSoup.
- Collect data into structured formats (e.g., dictionaries, lists) for further processing or analysis.

**6.Iterate and Extend:**
- Implement iteration if scraping multiple repositories or pages.
- Consider pagination logic if GitHub repository lists span multiple pages.

**7.Data Storage and Analysis:**
- Store extracted data in desired formats (e.g., CSV, JSON) for analysis or reporting purposes.
- Implement error handling and logging to manage potential issues during scraping.
